How to run:
	!IF NOT RUNNING THE SERVER ON YOUR LOCAL MACHINE, SKIP TO STEP 3!
	
	1. Run ServerMain in the evidence.clientserverpackage (make sure to add a Port number for the server to run on in the run configuration options - I use 8192).
		ServerMain now also requires a number of players to start the game at, e.g when x number of players have connected, start the timer / game. 2 is default
	
	2. A small GUI interface for the server should appear if you are, this will log the server's activity.
	
	3. Run login and give yourself a name, type in the address and port number for the server we are connecting to.  Port = the port number from step 1.
		IF YOU ARE RUNNING THE SERVER LOCALLY ON YOUR OWN PC: Address = localhost   
		IF YOU ARE NOT RUNNING THE SERVER LOCALLY ON YOUR OWN PC: You need the actual IP Address of the server
	
	4. The main window should appear, if the chat panel does not display "Successful connection" anywhere, then a connection has not been established with the server
	5. Assuming a connection was established, you should now be able to send messages and have them appear to every client connected to the server.
