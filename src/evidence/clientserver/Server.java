/**
 * The server is responsible for keeping track of any users connected to the server
 * and sending / receiving packets to and from them.  For example, if a player moves 
 * in their client, we must send a packet to the server containing the player's new 
 * location, and propagate that packet to the other user's so they can update that
 * player's location on their own client.
 * 
 * The server uses 4 different threads to handle different functionality that
 * the server may provide.  This is mainly because receive() will sit and wait
 * until it receives something through the socket.  If we did not have a separate 
 * thread for this, the entire server would sit and wait and this is not desirable.
