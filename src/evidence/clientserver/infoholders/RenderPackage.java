/**
 * A RenderPackage is a class that holds the objects a client needs to render 
 * the game view to the user.  Currently, a RenderPackage holds two walls, a list
 * of items and a String.  The walls represent wall's in the player's view that they 
 * may need to render, the inventory is the player's inventory and the String is a
 * string that represents the last action the user performed.
 * 
 * These are put into a RenderPackage to make serialization of all render components easier,
 * and easily accessible through one instance of a RenderPackage.
